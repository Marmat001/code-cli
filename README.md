# NoterJS Code CLI

An interactive browser-based coding environment, similar to a Jupyter Notebook, but for javascript. You can write Javascript, see it being executed, and write comprehensive documentation using the markdown editor. The workflow of creating this program is different from all my other projects, as it is in fact not me building it from scratch, rather me following a course called "React and Typescript: "Build a Portfolio Project" by Stephen Grider on Udemy. So why did I decide to throw this project into my portfolio? I was originally working on another project, where bundling in the browser would be a necessity for it to be successful. I wanted to try out my set of skills by building out something other than an ordinary internet page. After struggling for some time, and a lot of stack overflow searching I came to the conclusion that Webpack, my bundler of choice for that project, did not work in the browser. After some more research I discovered the bundler Esbuild. While reading the Esbuild documentation and scrolling through stackoverflow after experiencing a specific problem, I discovered a link to the course React and Typescript course on Udemy. I ended up taking the course as it covered many of the topics that I wanted to learn, one of them which was Typescript. The course was filled with so much knowledge and concepts that it took me a whole month of buidling, destroying, rebuilding on my own without peaking the course material, only allowing myself to google, to fully grasp the concepts and reasons for the architectural decision making. With that being said, I have rebuilt this project from scratch with the best of my ability to similar outcomes using different approaches and different methods to see why certain strategies worked better than others and this experience has truly taught me a lot. I absolutely believe I could build a comparable application from the ground up after completing this course, and this project has made me discover a dozen of programming tricks, even more than some of the other projects I have built on my own, which is why I decided to include this project.

## About The Build

Building this application was a great opportunity to familiarise myself with the essential concepts of: <br /> 
- Typescript and how to use React / Redux with Typescript <br />
- Simplifying state updates within Redux with the Immer library <br /> 
- Managing a project using a package-based architecture <br /> 
- Understanding the challenges of in-browser code transpiling and processing <br />
- How to safely handle and execute user-provided code directly in the browser <br />
- Automate deployment with the Lerna CLI

<br />
Some of the features provided in this application are:
<br /><br />

- Game search feature <br />
- Individual section for new / upcoming / most popular & searched games <br />
- Game page with detailed information about each game, including game description, release date, star rating, console availability and an interactive image gallery <br />
- Transition animations using framer motion <br />
- Navigation that underlines the current active page <br />
- Particle effects on homepage using ParticleJS <br />
- Mobile responsive
