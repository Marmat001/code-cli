# NoterJS Code CLI

An interactive browser-based coding environment, similar to a Jupyter Notebook, but for javascript. You can write Javascript, see it being executed, and write comprehensive documentation using the markdown editor. 

## About The Build

Building this application was a great opportunity to familiarise myself with the essential concepts of: <br /> 
- Typescript and how to use React / Redux with Typescript <br />
- Simplifying state updates within Redux with the Immer library <br /> 
- Managing a project using a package-based architecture <br /> 
- Understanding the challenges of in-browser code transpiling and processing <br />
- How to safely handle and execute user-provided code directly in the browser <br />
- Automate deployment with the Lerna CLI

<br />
Some of the features provided in this application are:
<br /><br />
